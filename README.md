# Carpet Buzzies
_Carpet Buzzies_ (formerly _Very Many Buzzies,_ or simply just _Buzzies_ if you like to be lazy) is an extension for Carpet Mod ([fabric-carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet)), that currently has only two features, both of which are related to bee nest generation on newly grown trees. However, this is quite quickly becoming a place where I just dump in whatever features I think will be useful, just cause.

You can find the current list of features [here](https://github.com/Redstoniaa/carpet-buzzies/wiki/Available-Settings).
