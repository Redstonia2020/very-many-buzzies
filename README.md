# Very Many Buzzies
A little mod that bumps up beenest generation chances on trees.

## But How-?
So this just gets rid of the random probability that determines if a beenest even tries to generate, so that beenests attempt to generate 100% of the time instead of just 5% or 1%.
As well as this, it also generates a beenest in every single spot that was considered for beenest generation, instead of just one of them. For straight trees like birch and small oak, this means you'll be often getting 3 beenests per tree rather than just one.
